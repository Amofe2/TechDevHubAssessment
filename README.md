# TechDevHubAssessment // Software Quality Engineer Assessment

Thank you for your being part of this wonderful program!

This technical test is designed to give us an idea of both your technical and communication skills. You're given a simple problem so you can focus on showing off the technique and skills you have learnt all through the program. We expect it to take a couple of hours/days to complete, though feel free to take as much or as little time as you feel necessary.

We're hoping to hear back from you in a week, but if real life gets in the way and you need a bit longer then just let us know.

We are looking to understand:

- The way you approach problems
- What trade-offs you may decide to make for the sake of time
- And of course your technical fand documentation ability.

So try and show off as much as possible!

You will be creating a regression test case document, and also testing the API provided. More on that later, but first please read the rules carefully.

## Rules

When you're ready for us to review your submission, create a pull request to this repository and request a review from [@Amofe2](https://github.com/Amofe2) and [@osupersunny](https://github.com/OsuperSunny).

To make sure your submission has the best chance of success, you should do the following:

- You must not commit to the main branch of this repository. Instead, create a branch out of the main branch as you were taught and then make a pull request with your solutions.
- The pull request body should contain all the necessary Testing documents and any screenshots if required.

If we like your submission, there will be a follow-up interview/discussion in which we will spend some time talking about the decisions and trade-offs you have made.


## Part One: Regression Testing

•	We would like you to create a regression test case document for our authentication system located at http://account.lykon.de/login. Feel free to use whatever tools and techniques you are already familiar with and don't forget to add the document (or the link to access it) in your repository.
•	Write a defect report should you notice any defect on the website. Don’t forget to add the defect severity to the report.

## Part Two: API Testing
Go to this link: https://dummyjson.com/docs/users
Go through the API documentations, test the API’s accordingly and write a test case on them.


We will be looking in particular at the clarity of your documentations (including comments where relevant), best practices and the: is it flexible enough to expand to many more test cases over time? We’ll also be interested in which test cases you documented and why - be prepared to discuss that in a follow-up interview/discussion.


# Remember! This test is the criteria for being part of the Test Automation Program as only successful candidates will be selected for the program, so Do your best. Wish you the best.
